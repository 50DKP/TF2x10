{"name":"TF2x10","tagline":"Multiply a Weapon's Stats by 10!","body":"## Multiply A Weapon Stats by 10: The Plugin [![Build Status](http://ff2.50dkp.com/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=TF2x10)](http://ff2.50dkp.com/jenkins/job/TF2x10/)\r\nIt's in the name! All weapon stats multipled by 10. Everything about that (un)balanced goodness that you can run on your own TF2 server.\r\n\r\nJoin our group for a list of servers running the latest and greatest: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tf2x10\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* SourceMod 1.6+\r\n* TF2Items\r\n* TF2Attributes\r\n* SteamTools\r\n* Updater\r\n\r\nFor the Updater bit: there will be times where Valve may change weapon attributes or add new ones. This is to ensure the server gets fast, timely updates to weapon attributes and any possible SourceMod plugin additions we have to complement the update. Highly recommended, but you can compile without the updater requirement if you so wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cvars\r\n`tf2x10_autoupdate` (default 1):\r\nTells updater.smx to automatically update this plugin. 0 = off, 1 = on.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_crits_diamondback` (default 10):\r\nNumber of crits after successful sap with Diamondback equipped.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_crits_fj` (default 10):\r\nNumber of crits after Frontier kill or for buildings. Half this for assists.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_crits_manmelter` (default 10):\r\nNumber of crits after Manmelter extinguishes player.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_enabled` (default 1):\r\nToggle TF2x10. 0 = disable, 1 = enable\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_gamedesc` (default 1):\r\nToggle setting game description. 0 = disable, 1 = enable.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_headscaling` (default 1):\r\nEnable any decapitation weapon (eyelander etc) to grow their head as they gain heads. 0 = off, 1 = on.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_headscalingcap` (float, default 6.0):\r\nThe number of heads before head scaling stops growing their head. 6.0 = 24 heads.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_healthcap` (default 2000):\r\nThe max health a player can have. -1 to disable.\r\n\r\n`tf2x10_includebots` (default 0):\r\n1 allows bots (MvM or not) to receive TF2x10 weapons, 0 disables this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Admin Commands\r\n`sm_tf2x10_disable`:\r\nDisable TF2x10.\r\n\r\n`sm_tf2x10_enable`:\r\nEnable TF2x10.\r\n\r\n`sm_tf2x10_getmod`:\r\nGets the current \"mod\" that is loaded over the default x10 weapons. See below.\r\n\r\n`sm_tf2x10_recache`:\r\nClears the x10 weapon trie cache and loads x10.default.txt. Useful if you're testing out attributes on-the-fly.\r\n\r\n`sm_tf2x10_setmod` *filename*:\r\nSets the current \"mod\". e.g. if the file is named `x10.myweaponstuffs.txt` then you will do `sm_tf2x10_setmod myweaponstuffs`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mods\r\nAll TF2x10 weapon stats are placed in `x10.default.txt` in the configs folder. The TF2x10 weapon plugin also includes rudimentary tf2items-esque coded weapon mods that will allow you to load different weapon attributes than what will be loaded from the main default file. An example of this is `x10.vshff2.txt`, which is manually loaded on map change by a VSH/FF2 x10 server I run. Things in this file will cancel out things in the default.\r\n\r\nNote that in your `x10.filenamehere.txt` file, the first line should be what you named your file.\r\n\r\nSee `x10.vshff2.txt` and how things are done if you want a good example. Please, NEVER touch `x10.default.txt` as that will be updated as Valve sends out weapon attribute changes, and it's so much easier to load a \"mod\" so you don't have to go through the hassle of modifying things.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Compatibility With Other Game Mods\r\nTF2x10's goal is for 100% compatibility with game mods. There may be one or two other game mods that will not ever work with x10, and that is fine. But things like Randomizer, Saxton Hale, Prop Hunt, etc. is what we're trying to be compatible with. Here's the full list:\r\n\r\n* **Advanced Weaponiser**: due to the way it gives weapons, will not load tf2x10 if present.\r\n* **Freak Fortress 2 & VS Saxton Hale**: should work mostly but some things (e.g. powerjack) and kunai may need to be adjusted. will post when I can get together everything.\r\n* **Randomizer**: currently has something going with it that it crashes(?) it may be my server. In my bitbucket, there's a very unstable randomizer in it that you can try out, but I'd much rather get it to where the x10 plugin can take over stuff without needing to modify the actual plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credits and Thanks\r\n**Coders**:\r\n\r\nInvisGhost - original x10 plugin to complement the tf2items txt\r\n\r\nIsatis - overhaul, implementing TF2Attributes and pretty much 90% of what you see in the source\r\n\r\nDark Skript - bugfixing, additional support\r\n\r\nRavenShadow - additional support\r\n\r\n**Weapon Attributists**:\r\n\r\nUltiMario - creating the mod and weapon attributes\r\n\r\nMr. Blue - PR and weapon attributes\r\n\r\n**Thanks**:\r\n\r\nFlaminSarge - for putting up with me and for some code examples I took (e.g. loading into trie) :p\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install Instructions\r\n\r\nPlace all three folders in your `addons/sourcemod/` folder. Launch, and go!\r\n\r\nIf you are having any issues with the plugin itself, please post in the [AlliedModders thread](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=270723) instead of contacting anyone on the x10 team individually so we can better help you.
